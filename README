README for procimap
-------------------

procimap allows you to run Procmail on a remote IMAP mailbox. While
Procmail in this context is as powerful and flexible as ever, there
are some obvious limitations to what you can (or will want to) do; but
the regular IMAP move, delete, and copy operations are available.

This package started out as a fork of <http://imapassassin.sf.net/>
and still contains some code parts inherited from that project. Thus,
the code as a whole is GPL, although the parts by yours truly are
dual-licensed GPL/BSD "new style".

(Incidentally, running SpamAssassin from Procimap is one of the
reasons I wanted this -- for one thing, SpamAssassin rule updates etc.
can be handled without a need for restarting procimap, and also,
obvious optimizations are possible by running spamd/spamc instead of
just the regular SpamAssassin.)
