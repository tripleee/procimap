README for procimap
===================

http://github.com/tripleee/procimap

procimap allows you to run Procmail on a remote IMAP mailbox. While
Procmail in this context is as powerful and flexible as ever, there
are some obvious limitations to what you can (or will want to) do; but
the regular IMAP move, delete, and copy operations are available.

This package started out as a fork of <http://imapassassin.sf.net/>
and still contains some code parts inherited from that project. Thus,
the code as a whole is GPL, although the parts by yours truly are
dual-licensed GPL/BSD "new style".


Installing procimap
-------------------

Installing is a bit idiosyncratic.  There is a simple build script
which builds procimap and Makefile.conf from their corresponding
*.in files.  Any existing build will be overwritten with the default
(or, as the case may be, your locally configured default) parameters.

Run `./build.pl` with the default values you want, then run `makeÂ´.

The top-level GNUMakefile also has a `deb' target for building a
Debian (and hence, Ubuntu etc) binary package.


Getting started
---------------

Create a simple configuration file with your user name, password,
and IMAP server name, and make sure it is not readable by others.

    touch procimap.conf
    chmod 600 procimap.conf
    $VISUAL procimap.conf

Its contents should look something like this:

    server imap.example.com
    user me
    password xyzzy
    ssl 1

Then, create a simple `procimaprc' file, perhaps as simple as this:

    NL="
    "
    LOG=`formail -XFrom: -XTo: -XCC: -XSubject: -XDate: -XMessage-ID:`"$NL"

For experimentation, you might want to add some testing options, such
as --no-act and --single-run, as well as perhaps --statedir=. (or you
can equivalently add those to the configuration file instead; use 1 to
indicate truth and 0 to indicate false for boolean options).

    procimap --config procimap.conf --statedir=. --single-run --no-act

DO NOT USE THE --password OPTION unless you are completely sure you are
on a system where only yourself can get a process listing, which reveals
the command-line arguments to processes to anyone who cares to look.

If you have a large inbox, perhaps you want to manually set the
message index to a high number in the file `procimap.mid' in the state
directory, so that you do not scan thousands of messages every time
you experiment.  (What is "high" for you?  I don't know.  Look at the
IMAP message index of a recent message in your regular IMAP client, or
even more manually telnet to the server and ask it.  Or brute-force
it; start with an insanely high number and bisect.)

There is a manual page with an EXAMPLE section.  If you wish to read
the manual page without installing the package, it is embedded as POD
in the procimap source file.  Look for the first `=head1' entry.

The error message "SSL is unsupported as an attribute" is a symptom of
a broken Perl IMAP back-end library; you want to upgrade to version
3.21 or higher of Mail::IMAPClient (i.e. version 3.20-2 or higher of
the Debian package libmail-imapclient-perl), or try without SSL (tsk tsk).
